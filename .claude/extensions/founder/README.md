# Founder Extension (v2.0)

Strategic business analysis tools for founders and entrepreneurs. Integrates forcing question patterns and decision frameworks inspired by Y Combinator office hours methodology and gstack.

## What's New in v2.0

- **Task Integration**: Commands now create tasks and use `/plan` + `/implement` workflow
- **Three-Phase Workflow**: Context gathering, forcing questions, synthesis
- **Language-Based Routing**: `/plan` and `/implement` route to founder-specific skills
- **Report Output**: Strategy reports go to `strategy/` directory
- **Legacy Mode**: `--quick` flag preserves standalone behavior

## Overview

This extension provides three commands for strategic business analysis:

| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/market` | TAM/SAM/SOM market sizing | Market sizing report |
| `/analyze` | Competitive landscape analysis | Competitive analysis with positioning map |
| `/strategy` | Go-to-market strategy | GTM strategy with 90-day plan |

## Installation

This extension is automatically available when loaded via `<leader>ac` in Neovim.

## MCP Tool Setup

The founder extension integrates MCP tools for enhanced data gathering.

### SEC EDGAR (No Setup Required)

SEC EDGAR provides access to public company filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K). No API key or configuration needed.

- **Fully free**, unlimited access to SEC public filings
- **Used by**: market-agent (for public company financials and market sizing)
- **Lazy loaded**: Only starts when market-agent is invoked

### Firecrawl (Free Tier - 500 credits/month)

Firecrawl enables full-page web scraping for competitor analysis.

**Setup**:
1. Visit https://firecrawl.dev/
2. Create a free account
3. Copy API key from dashboard
4. Add to shell profile:
   ```bash
   export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   ```
5. Restart terminal or source your profile

**Capabilities**:
- `scrape`: Full page content as markdown
- `crawl`: Recursive site crawling
- `map`: Site structure mapping
- `extract`: LLM-powered data extraction

**Used by**: analyze-agent (for competitor website analysis)

**Note**: Firecrawl is optional. If API key is not configured, analyze-agent will fall back to WebSearch for competitor research.

## Workflow

### Task Workflow (Default)

```
/market "fintech payments"
    |
    v
[1] Create task in state.json/TODO.md
    |
    v
[2] Run /plan (routes to skill-founder-plan)
    ├── Mode selection
    ├── Forcing questions (6-8 questions)
    └── Generate plan with gathered context
    |
    v
[3] Run /implement (routes to skill-founder-implement)
    ├── Load plan with context
    ├── Execute phases (TAM/SAM/SOM/Report)
    └── Generate report artifact
    |
    v
[4] Task completed
    ├── Report: strategy/market-sizing-{slug}.md
    └── Summary: specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/summaries/
```

### Legacy Workflow (--quick)

```
/market --quick fintech payments
    |
    v
skill-market -> market-agent
    |
    v
founder/market-sizing-{datetime}.md
```

## Key Patterns

### Forcing Questions

Every command uses forcing questions to extract specific, evidence-based information. Questions are asked one at a time, and vague answers are pushed back on.

**Anti-patterns detected and rejected**:
- "Everyone needs this" -> Push for specific customer
- "Many businesses" -> Push for named companies
- "The market is huge" -> Push for specific numbers with sources

### Mode-Based Operation

Each command offers 3-4 operational modes that give users explicit scope control. Mode selection happens early and affects all subsequent analysis.

### Three-Phase Workflow (v2.0)

1. **Context Gathering**: Load file, task artifacts, or ask initial question
2. **Interactive Questions**: Forcing questions tailored to gathered context
3. **Synthesis**: Generate report using template

### Completeness Principle

"When AI reduces marginal cost of completeness to near-zero, optimize for full implementation rather than shortcuts."

All commands evaluate multiple scenarios, not just the optimistic one.

### Decision Frameworks

- **Two-way doors**: Reversible decisions - move fast, 70% information
- **One-way doors**: Irreversible decisions - be rigorous, 90% information
- **Inversion**: Also ask "What makes us fail?"
- **Focus as subtraction**: Explicitly document what NOT to do

## Output Artifacts

### Task Mode

| Command | Report | Tracking |
|---------|--------|----------|
| /market | `strategy/market-sizing-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |
| /analyze | `strategy/competitive-analysis-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |
| /strategy | `strategy/gtm-strategy-{slug}.md` | `specs/{NNN}_{SLUG}/` |

### Legacy Mode (--quick)

| Command | Artifact |
|---------|----------|
| /market --quick | `founder/market-sizing-{datetime}.md` |
| /analyze --quick | `founder/competitive-analysis-{datetime}.md` |
| /strategy --quick | `founder/gtm-strategy-{datetime}.md` |

## Migration from v1.0

| v1.0 Command | v2.0 Equivalent |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `/market fintech` | `/market --quick fintech` (standalone) |
| | `/market "fintech analysis"` (task workflow) |
| `/analyze stripe` | `/analyze --quick stripe` (standalone) |
| `/strategy launch` | `/strategy --quick launch` (standalone) |

**Key Changes**:
- Default behavior now creates tasks
- Use `--quick` for v1.0 behavior
- Reports go to `strategy/` (task) or `founder/` (--quick)
- Task tracking with status updates
